## Owner and Contributors
This project was intially created by Creative Tim  (https://www.creative-tim.com/), They worked on the Angular Template.
This project was forked by Ilyes Chaabane, where more views added to the template and a backend side created to render the project Full Stack.

## Tech Stack
This project follows the MEAN Stack (MongoDB,ExpressJS,AngularJS,NodeJS)

## Terminal Commands

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0 and angular 4.x.

In order to get the backend Server running 
1. Set up a mongodb database called "bootcamp_management" so that the server connects to it once it starts
2. Install NodeJs from [NodeJs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en). 
3. Run in terminal: ```npm install```
4. Run in the Terminal `npm run dev`

There is a python ML model that will be used in this project so you might wanna configure the env
1. Run `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
2. Create a file called requirements.txt
3. Add to the file
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
scikit-learn
matplotlib
requests
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Finally in your terminal run python3 model.py

Now Run Angular from Angular CLI
1. Make sure you have installed [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) already. If not, please install.
2. Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
